I failed my duty to the bell, but the reaper did not return. Why does my punishment not end?

I sometimes ring the bell again to hear the lordâ€™s tune once again. Through my trials, I have discovered how to perform a portion of the holy song, but the other notes have failed to reveal themselves to me. 

Oh how I wish to be freed from my torment. Lord deliver upon salvation
