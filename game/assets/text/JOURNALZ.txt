[b]RESIDENT CONTROL DEPARTMENT 623385
SUPERVISOR MANUAL[/b]

In an effort to control the rise of dangerous elements present in the land below, we created the department of population stabilization. Though our operation may seem an overly complicated one to some, its existence is needed as celestial beings are not allowed to directly cull the population. Therefore to ensure the human population does not explode and overtake the other residents of earth, we will empower the souls of the recently deceased humans with celestial patterns and prompt them to smite their brethren. An ingenious workaround if I do say so myself.
