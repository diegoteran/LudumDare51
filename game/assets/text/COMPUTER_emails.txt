Thanks again for agreeing to take over for me! Just remember the [b]combination to the safe in the office upstairs is green blue green[b]. It’s locked using a pretty trivial temporal lock, just to keep it out of the operator’s reach.

Supervisor568:
Sounds good. Oh and I noticed the [b]door to the office upstairs gets unlocked at the start of each new operators shift[b]? Any reason for that?

Supervisor567:
Thats just so I could easily leave to go help them. Don't worry I set it up to lock after they figure out what to do.
